NB: gotchas:

The gx_window_get/set_property functions are awkward since gobjects
use such names to set object properties, but in X11 terms they would
send and retrieve X Window properties to/from the xserver.

Currently gx_window_get/set_property correspond to the gobject
varient and we have gx_window_get/set_xproperty for the X11 kind.

The xproto defines an enum that should be named GXWindowClass, but
that conflicts with the the class definition for GXWindow objects.
